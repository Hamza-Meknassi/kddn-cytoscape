{"name":"KDDN app for Cytoscape","tagline":"","body":"### What is KDDN\r\nKDDN is a systems biology method and tool to leverage existing domain knowledge and specific experimental data to model biological networks. It integratively characterizes the dynamic nature of biological systems by jointly modeling the network structure under different experimental conditions and guide the learning by existing domain knowledge.\r\n\r\n### Who shall use KDDN\r\nPeople doing bioinformatics, computational biology and even beyond with some dynamic profiling data want to explore. KDDN provides a network perspective of the data to show how the interactions among the variables form and change.\r\n\r\n### How to use KDDN\r\nDeveloped as a Cytoscape app, KDDN can be conveniently used from within Cytoscape. Straightforward interface and help documents guide users to configure, run and evaluate experiments.\r\n\r\n### More information\r\nDetails regarding the methodology can be found at\r\n```\r\nY.
