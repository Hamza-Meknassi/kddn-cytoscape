    <h1>Running Options</h1>

    <p>
      When the input data meets the minimum requirements corresponding to experiment condition, run button is enabled to allow users to carry out experiments.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Want differential edge p-value</b> - Enabled only in two conditions experiments. Check it will add more running time to perform permutation test to get edge-specific p-values for differential edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Number of permutations</b> - The number of permutations used. It is enabled only in two conditions experiments and want differential edge p-value is checked.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      After going through all steps, a final hit of run button will initiate the analysis. A progress bar informs users the progress of the three most time-consuming stages (if necessary according to settings): finding &lambda;<sub>2</sub>, finding &theta; and calculate p-value.
