    <h1>Model Parameters</h1>

    <p>
      Model parameters specifies all parameters in KDDN. Parameters
      can be set in auto mode or manual mode. Parameters are enabled
      or disabled according to specific settings.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>&lambda;<sub>1</sub></b> - It controls the overall density
        of the learned network. Larger &lambda;<sub>1</sub> leads to
        sparser networks. The default is in auto mode where it is
        calculated automatically from data. When manual mode is
        chosen, a spinner shows up to allow user to set a value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>&lambda;<sub>2</sub></b> - It controls the density of
        identified differential edges. It is enabled only in two
        conditions experiments. Larger &lambda;<sub>2</sub> leads to
        fewer differential edges. The default is in auto mode where it
        is found automatically according to the value of &alpha;. When
	manual mode is chosen, a spinner shows up to allow user to set
	a value, and &alpha; setting is disabled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>&alpha;</b> - The desired significance level of differential edges. It is used to find the corresponding value of &lambda;<sub>2</sub> automatically. It is enabled only in two conditions experiments and &lambda;<sub>2</sub> is set to auto. Check the default checkbox resets it to 0.05.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>&theta;</b> - The degree of prior knowledge incorporation. It is enabled only when the optional prior knowledge network file is provided. The default is in auto mode where it is found automatically according to the value of &delta;. When manual mode is chosen, a spinner shows up to allow user to set a value, and &delta; setting is disabled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>&delta;</b> - The maximum tolerable deviation in the worst case scenario of prior knowledge incorporation. It is used to find the corresponding value of &theta; automatically. It is enabled only when the optional prior knowledge network file is provided and &theta; is set to auto. Check the default checkbox resets it to 0.1.
      </li>
    </ul>
