    <h1>Input Data</h1>

    <p>
      Profiling data and domain knowledge are specified in this step.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Gene list</b> - A text file containing a list of nodes
        (genes, proteins) involved in the study. One node per line. No
        row/column names.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data file 1</b> - Profiling data (gene expression, protein
        expression, RNA-seq RPKM, etc.) of condition 1 in a text file
	with no row/column names. One node per row, corresponding 
	to the same order in gene list file. Tab or comma delimited. 
	Data should be properly normalized.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data file 2</b> - Profiling data (gene expression, protein
        expression, RNA-seq RPKM, etc.) of condition 2 in a text file
	with no row/column names. Not required or ignored when
	experiment condition is set to single condition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Prior knowledge network</b> - Prior knowledge of network
        topology in a text file with no row/column names. An edge per
        row, with two node names separated by tab or comma. Or a KGML
        file downloaded from KEGG website. It is optional. If
        provided, KDDN will use the knowledge in learning, otherwise
        it relies solely on data.
      </li>
    </ul>
