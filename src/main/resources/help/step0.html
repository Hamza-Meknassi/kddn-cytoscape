    <h1>Experiment Condition</h1>

    <p>
      KDDN can work with both single condition data and two conditions
      data. Users need to tell KDDN which learning is requested.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Two Conditions</b> - Data for two condtions are
        provided. KDDN learns the differential edges between the two
	conditions. Red edges highlight connections exist only under
        condition 1 and green edges highlight connections exist only
        under condition 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Single Condition</b> - Only data of condition 1 is used (or
        provided). KDDN learns a static network structure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A demo dataset is provided for users to understand the usage and
      explore the settings.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Load Demo</b> - Load the demo dataset. Users can cancel the
	demo dataset or replace with new dataset.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Reset</b> - Reset KDDN to initial status.
