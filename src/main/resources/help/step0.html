    <h1>Experiment Condition</h1>

    <p>
      KDDN can work with both single condition data and two conditions
      data. Users need to tell KDDN which learning is requested.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Two Conditions</b> - Data for two conditions are
        provided. KDDN learns the differential edges between the two
	conditions. Red edges highlight connections exist only under
        condition 1 and green edges highlight connections exist only
        under condition 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Single Condition</b> - Only data of condition 1 is used (or
        provided). KDDN learns a static network structure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A demo dataset is provided for users to understand the usage and
      explore the settings.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Load Demo</b> - Load the demo dataset including all
	required or optional files, and set all parameters to auto
	mode. The dataset contains 18 genes. Users can cancel the demo
	dataset or replace with a new dataset (make sure the number of
	genes are the same). The demo dataset can be viewed at https://github.com/tianye03/kddn-cytoscape/tree/master/src/main/resources/demo
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Reset</b> - Reset KDDN to initial status.
